## ü©∫ Breast Cancer Detection using AI  

AI and machine learning project leveraging the **CBIS-DDSM mammography dataset** (sourced from Kaggle) to enhance early breast cancer detection accuracy and assist radiologists in diagnosis.  

### ‚ùó Problem Statement  
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide.  
Early detection through mammography significantly improves survival rates, but manual interpretation can be time-consuming and prone to errors.  
This project aims to **develop a machine learning model that automates classification of mammogram images (benign vs malignant)** to support radiologists in making faster and more accurate diagnoses.  

### üéØ Objective  
- **Automate Detection**: Build ML models to classify mammogram scans into benign or malignant.  
- **Improve Accuracy**: Reduce false negatives that can delay treatment.  
- **Data Wrangling & Feature Engineering**: Clean, preprocess, and extract key features from imaging data.  
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluate Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and other classifiers for performance.  
- **Practical Application**: Provide a scalable AI tool to enhance early detection and assist healthcare professionals.  

### üìä Dataset Details  
- **Source**: [CBIS-DDSM on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/skooch/ddsm-mammography)  
- **Type**: Curated mammography images with annotations.  
- **Size**: Thousands of labeled samples (benign, malignant).  
- **Features**: Includes breast density, pathology labels, ROI images.  
- **Purpose**: Benchmark dataset widely used for research in breast cancer detection and medical AI.
